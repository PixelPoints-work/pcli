This repository contains code and notes created while following along with the 
book [*Powerful Command-Line Applications in Go*]
(https://pragprog.com/titles/rggo/powerful-command-line-applications-in-go/) 
by David L. P. Hurst. The book focuses on building effective command-line 
applications in Go, covering various techniques and best practices.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document my journey through the book and 
provide examples of the concepts learned. The code is intended for learning 
purposes only and is not meant for production use.
